VERY IMPORTANT

For each installation, you must define "ID" in /usr/local/cyberspark/cyberspark.id.txt 
to reflect the ID of the instance you wish to run. Without setting it properly, 
no sniffers will launch. This value is picked up by the 'cyberspark' script in the
init.d directory.

Something like this as content of the file:
CS2

It must match the ID you use in the /properties/ files.
